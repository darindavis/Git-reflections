What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git is created along with default files and sub-directories.  Without those default files, Git doesn't know where its starting point is.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository.  It provides a way to specify which files should be included in a commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use 'git diff --staged' to see differences between the staging area and most recent commit.  All changes listed should be part of a logical change.
